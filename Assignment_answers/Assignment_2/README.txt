How to run Assignment 2:

code:
> ruby Catarecha_BPC_Assignment2_main.rb

Please make sure that ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt are present in the same folder.

The script will create a report called Catarecha_BPC_assignment2_report.txt. There you will find:
- A curated list of binary interactions between all members of the original GeneList.
- One entry for each netwok found, describing its components, the GO processes and the KEGG pathways they are involved in.
