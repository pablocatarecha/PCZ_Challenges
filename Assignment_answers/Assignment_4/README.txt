How to run Assignment 4:

code:
> ruby Catarecha_BPC_assignment4_main.rb

Please make sure that TAIR10_cds_20101214_updated.fa and pep.fa are present in the same folder. You will have to unzip the original compressed files.

The script will create a folder called Databases and store BLAST db in it.

The script will create two additional files:
- Arath_tr.fa contains the translated database of A. thaliana.
- Best_reciprocal_hits.txt contains the script results.
